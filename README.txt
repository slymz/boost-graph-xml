BoostGraphRapidxml is a single header "library" that defines 
functionality to make rapidxml::xml_document satisfy Incident Graph 
concept (directed or undirected), which in turn allows rapidxml DOM to 
be walk and talk like a Boost Graph (i.e. use all the rich Graph 
algorithms, in particular traversal.
